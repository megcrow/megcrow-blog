<p>This recipe was taken from a reddit post I found long ago, its original source is from <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilyhorng/travel-to-new-york-city-without-leaving-your-house-with-this">Tasty</a>, though some have suggested the recipe was heavily influenced by <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/12/serious-eats-halal-cart-style-chicken-and-rice-white-sauce-recipe.html">this recipe</a> from Serious Eats. I don't know, I'm going to stay out of it. But I do know that no matter the original author of this recipe, it's pretty damn good. I might venture to say....it's my favorite. I've modified it a little to suit my experience and tastes and I am open to any suggestions from my many devoted readers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, enough of that. Here it is:</p>
<h2>NYC Street Cart Style Chicken and Rice</h2>
<p>To begin, you will need the following tools:</p>
<p>1. One large pot to cook everything in (yay for minimal dishes!)</p>
<p>2. One medium sized bowl to mix the yogurt sauce in</p>
<p>3. Something to marinate the chicken in-- a bowl, a plastic bag, anything lying around that would be appropriate in your mind.</p>
<p>And the necessary ingredients are as follows:</p>
<p>For the yogurt sauce:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 cup plain yogurt -- I use whole milk, of the non-greek variety</li>
<li>1 tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
<li>1 lemon juiced or 3 tbsp bottled lemon juice because you hate squeezing lemons</li>
<li>1 pinch of sugar, about a teaspoon or tablespoon, I don't really know you can't even really taste it to be honest, it just balances out the acidity of the vinegar and lemon juice</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
</ul>
<p>For the chicken:</p>
<p>Listen, I know it sounds hard, but you've got to marinate the chicken. It's the only way to get the beautiful harmony of tastes in there. This is the part I dread the most but it's not that bad--save for chopping the garlic. It'll be over quickly though, I promise, and way worth it. Marinate the chicken for at least 15 minutes but an hour is best.</p>
<p>So here's what you'll need for the marinating:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 tsp coriander</li>
<li>1 tsp oregano</li>
<li>1.5 tsp salt</li>
<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>Another darn lemon--or 3 tsp lemon juice</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, or more, because there is no such thing as too much garlic and I will not be convinced otherwise.</li>
<li>1-2 lbs boneless, skinless, chicken thighs</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the rice:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups basmati rice (or long grain rice, depending on what you have)</li>
<li>Ideally, 4 cups chicken stock -- I usually never have this much chicken stock lying around so I use whatever I have and substitute water for the rest.</li>
<li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
<li>2 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tsp cumin</li>
<li>1 tsp coriander</li>
<li>1 onion, any size will do, we don't judge here.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Miscellaneous:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sriracha</li>
<li>Cilantro, if you're not genetically predisposed to be offended by that suggestion</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>And now, the moment we've all been waiting for...........</h3>
<h3>.......</h3>
<h3>........</h3>
<h3>how to actually cook this thing</h3>
<h3>Step One</h3>
<p>Marinate that chicken. Get it over with, the longer you wait the more insurmountable the task will become. First, make sure you have defrosted the chicken. A small, quiet mental breakdown is perfectly ok if you haven't. The silver lining in marinating is if your chicken is still a frozen meat brick, the time spent marinating will defrost it a little. Probably not enough, but a little anyway. Dump the chicken in whatever you found to marinate it in and add the spices, olive oil, and lemon juice. Chop the garlic and throw that in there too. Mix it all around together so that everything's distributed nicely and put it in the fridge where they ingredients can all get aquainted with eachother.</p>
<h3>Step Two</h3>
<p>While the chicken is marinating, let's make the yogurt sauce. I often eat a lot of the yogurt and sauce while I'm making it so that makes this step a nice treat, especially after the durge of chicken marinating. It's pretty simple, just throw all the ingredients in a bowl again....the yogurt, the lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, the salt, sugar, you get the deal. Mix it up and gently toss that baby into the fridge as well, extra points if it knocks into the marinade and spills everywhere and you question the validity of your existence.</p>
<h3>Step Three</h3>
<p>Get that big cooking pot, turn the heat on to medium-high, throw a dab of olive oil into it, and let that heat up. You'll know it's ready when you can smell the olive oil. Once that's occurred, cook the chicken by laying each piece flat against the bottom of the pan, making sure they don't overlap, and dump the remainder of marinade into the pot as well. You might have to cook the chicken in batches, which to me is always heart breaking. I try to stuff as many chicken thighs as I can in the pot but sometimes they just won't all fit. Then I sigh and carry on with my life. Hear that sizzle, smell the garlic, and rejoice in the reward for your earlier efforts. I cook the chicken for at least 8 minutes on each side, sometimes more depending how big the pieces are.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>&nbsp;Step Four -- The Final Countdown</h3>
<p>Once the chicken is done, remove it from the pot and place it in a dish or something of equivalent use. Chop up the onion into little square pieces and throw them into the pot you cooked the chicken in along with a dab more olive oil. Keep the heat to medium-high. Get the coriander, cumin, and turmeric and throw them in there as well, giving it a stir to spread the love. Let that cook together until the onions get a little browned and soft, then add the rice. Stir again and cook for a few minutes, then add the chicken stock and salt. Once that comes to a boil, turn the heat down to low and cover. Distract yourself from ennui for 20-30 minutes, and tada! Your rice is done. Cut the chicken into little bite-sized pieces and add them in with the rice, stirring them to approximate uniform distribution. Wait another 5 minutes for the chicken to heat through, and there you are. You've done it, congratulations. Spoon the heavenly mixture into a bowl and top it with several heaping spoonfuls of the yogurt sauce, a sprinkle of cilantro, and a dousing of sriracha proportional to your spice tolerance.&nbsp;</p>
